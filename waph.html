    <h4>Course Information:This course will cover fundamental concepts of web application development, encompassing both front-end technologies like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end technologies such as PHP and MySQL. Additionally, it will delve into the realm of web application security, examining vulnerabilities and potential attacks through practical exercises. Strategies for secure programming will also be discussed to mitigate the risk of web application vulnerabilities and attacks.<h4>

    <h4>Lab 1 Overview: This Lab 1 primarily focuses on understanding the practical implementation of how the http request and responses work. Initially, A tool called wireshark is used to capture and analyze the HTTP requests information. Initially Requests are recorded and analysed using the existing simple web server and analysed. Later the same is performed in the terminal using Telnet and then compared with the before results. Later we proceeded on developing the simple CGI program and deployed it to the web server and a html code is also written in C and converted to CGI program and deployed it to the server.Developing web server with PHP is also explored and front end commands like echo, curl are used to provide data through the request and the Request and responses are recorded and analysed with the wireshark tool.<h4>

    <h4>Lab 2 Overview: In this Basic front end development is done using html, css, javascript. First a simple web page is deveoloped using HTML syntax and then modified this code to add the head shot and then forms are added to this. Then Javascript is introduced and different types of js code is written like inline js and external js and then a digital and analog clock and some tasks are done for this to get a better understanding of this. after this Asynchronous requests to the backend web server are made using AJX requests and the network is used in the browser to inspect these requests and responses. Proceeding to this, css code is written in the code like internal css and inline css and an external css code is written and modified the way page is displayed. after this, jquery is installed and post and get requests are made to the backend server and understood how Jquery AJAX requests are made. Later, dived into intergrating web apis into the code, two apis are used to make requests to them and the response data is displayed on the webpages asynchronously.<h4>

    <h4> Hackathon 1 Overview: Hackathon-1 is focused on identifying cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, finding code vulnerabilities, and adopting OWASP guidelines to maintain safe programming practices and prevent XSS events. The laboratory is divided into two tasks. Task one entails assaulting the URL http://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/. Through six stages. Task 2 aims to reduce the impact of XSS attacks by adding safe coding approaches like validation of inputs and output sanitizing After finishing each activity, documentation is prepared in markdown format and a PDF report is generated using the Pandoc software.<h4>
